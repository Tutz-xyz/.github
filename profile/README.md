### Master Escaping

Mastering the art of escaping in a TUTZ is a thrilling journey of wit, strategy, and quick thinking. Imagine being locked in a cell, with only your ingenuity and a few hidden tools at your disposal. As you travel thru the challenges, gather tools, engage in the black market, you quickly begin thinking of a strategy that will set your freedom, with every step, you get closer to being an escapee(trust me, it's your firsst amendment right.)

### Black Market

A market run by the most sthealthy criminals, providing equipment to escape, to battle, all snuck carefully within the prison and a currency that was tricked in by corrupt authorities and is seemingly just a currency to buy food within the prison, but in the reality, it's the main reason for escapes, riots, a carefully thought plan that is legally impossible to get rid of. So, will you join the Black Market, become a seller, a buyer? Given how many advantages this market offers over the others, but are the advantages enough to get you?
